# game
One of three branches from my first game. 
I write fantasy stories. I have a lot of them. I have been waiting so long for Baldurs Gate Three and I have been furloughed.
This presented the perfect time to learn to code,so I have decided to turn some of my scenes into games. 
They will improve as I get better at coding over time.
